#### Data Processing for Fast Depth Coding Using Deep Learning

* This project is for processing the data before training the model.

* Data (csv files and TFRecords) are stored in the ```/data``` folder under the HOME directory. E.g., ```/home/ubuntu/data/``` (Linux) or ```/Users/pharrell_wang/data/``` (macOS)
