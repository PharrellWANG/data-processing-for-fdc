#### Data Pre-Processing for Fast Depth Coding Using Deep Learning

##### Introduction

* This project is for processing the data before training the model for intra-mode-prediction.

* [Click here to see the behaviour details of the project](http://fast-depth-coding.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collecting.html#behaviours-of-the-project)

##### Caveats

* Data (csv files and TFRecords) are stored in the ```/data``` folder under the HOME directory. E.g., ```/home/ubuntu/data/``` (Linux) or ```/Users/pharrell_wang/data/``` (macOS)

* Remember to create ```/data/step1_output/``` and ```/data/step2_output/``` folders manually before using this project. (If you get the error traceback of *FileNotFoundError*, you need to create that folder first).
