Branch notes
============

1. branch name: ``angular_modes__with_smooth_blocks_removed``

2. Motivated by the fact that: .. pull-quote:: flat regions will trap cnn into ill condition. I decided to remove the regions where the edge strength is under 100.

3. classification for 33 angular modes. Applicable to DMM1 (where DMM1 only search the neighbor regions).
